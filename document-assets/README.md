# Document Assets

This folder contains image assets used by the Task Management frontend (`task-management`).

Usage:
- Keep all UI images and screenshots here.
- Reference images from the frontend using relative paths, e.g. `../document-assets/p1.jpg` or via the public/static pipeline used by your build tool.

Notes:
- Do not modify file names used directly in code unless you update references in the frontend components.
- If you want additional organized subfolders (e.g., `icons/`, `screenshots/`), say so and I will create them and move assets.
